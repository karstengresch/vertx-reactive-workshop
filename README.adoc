== The Micro-Homeplan Application

This is a short description of the scenario we will be working throughout the labs

Itâ€™s going to be a fake home appliance IOT management app, where we will be able to regulate the temperature in different rooms at our home. The application is composed of a set of microservices:

* The *_homeplan_* - this is a service which allows home owners to register and review their homeplan providing the temperature in each of the rooms in their house and the heat regulating applicances in each room. 

* The *_device management_* - this is a component which receives registration and update requests on the devices.

*  The *_sensor generator_* - this is a ficticious service emitting every 20 secs an event indicating the room temperature dependent on the state of the heating device (ON/OFF and INCREASING/DECREASING temperature)

* The *_homeplan regulator_* - this is a service which reads our current homeplan and based on the emmitted temperature in the room it regulates the action a device has to take to enforece the plan ie. INCREASE, DECREASE temperature of TURNOFF the device.

TIME ESTIMATION 30 MINUTES
FOLLOWED by 15 MINUTES reviewing the solution

== Concepts visited in this LAB

- http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#event_bus[The EventBus]
- Clustering and http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-core/java/#_using_shared_data_with_vert_x[Shared Data on Vert.x]
- 

== Organizers

. Provide solution from - LAB-1 in branch LAB-1 
. Pre-Requisites: and cluster it (infinispan) --> PROVIDE as part of the INITIAL version of LAB 1 Solution


== PARTICIPANTS

.Maven Command To Run VertX outside OCP
----
mvn comiple vertx:run -Dvertx.runArgs="-cluster -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
----

. clone/unzip "ReactiveVertX Branch - LAB 1"
. Create Content for verticles in _device-management_ service
  .. consume: Messages from #device-reg on the bus and complete register Device action
  .. ADD the devices into a shared-map (as in previous lab point ....) --WE WILL PROVIDE METHOD FOR THIS
  .. Log operation on console??? WE WILL PROVIDE METHOD FOR THIS THEY JUST NEED TO PUT THE LOGGING

. Create Content for verticles in _*homeplan*_
  .. send: Messages to #device-reg on the bus (REMOVE DUMMY IMPLEMENTATION and implement content of sendDevicesRegistration method

. TESTS
   .. Register HomePlan and seeing on console the devices being registered (give REST Calls)
