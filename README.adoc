== The Micro-Homeplan Application

This is a short description of the scenario we will be working throughout the labs

Itâ€™s going to be a fake home appliance IOT management app, where we will be able to regulate the temperature in different rooms at our home. The application is composed of a set of microservices:

* The *_homeplan_* - this is a service which allows home owners to register and review their homeplan providing the temperature in each of the rooms in their house and the heat regulating applicances in each room. 

* The *_device management_* - this is a component which receives registration and update requests on the devices.

*  The *_sensor generator_* - this is a ficticious service emitting every 20 secs an event indicating the room temperature dependent on the state of the heating device (ON/OFF and INCREASING/DECREASING temperature)

* The *_homeplan regulator_* - this is a service which reads our current homeplan and based on the emmitted temperature in the room it regulates the action a device has to take to enforece the plan ie. INCREASE, DECREASE temperature of TURNOFF the device.
