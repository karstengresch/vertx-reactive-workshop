== The Micro-Homeplan Application

This is a short description of the scenario we will be working throughout the labs

Itâ€™s going to be a fake home appliance IOT management app, where we will be able to regulate the temperature in different rooms at our home. The application is composed of a set of microservices:

* The *_homeplan_* - this is a service which allows home owners to register and review their homeplan providing the temperature in each of the rooms in their house and the heat regulating applicances in each room. 

* The *_device management_* - this is a component which receives registration and update requests on the devices.

*  The *_sensor generator_* - this is a ficticious service emitting every 20 secs an event indicating the room temperature dependent on the state of the heating device (ON/OFF and INCREASING/DECREASING temperature)

* The *_homeplan regulator_* - this is a service which reads our current homeplan and based on the emmitted temperature in the room it regulates the action a device has to take to enforece the plan ie. INCREASE, DECREASE temperature of TURNOFF the device.

== Software/Hardware Pre-Requisites

* BYOD Preperation

  **  Hard Disk: 20 Gb,
  **  Mem: 8 Gb,
  **  CPU: Good one


* Software

  ** JDK 1.8 (test java -version)
  ** MAVEN 3.3+ (mvn --version)
  ** oc tools https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases (download for your environment from the bottom of the page)
  ** docker installed
  ** IDE (eg. JBDS, Eclipse, iDEA)

== Openshift/Origin Setup

* Openshift Origin 'oc cluster up'

The following commands will give you a local Openshift Origin environment to deploy the microservices on 

[source, shell]
----
oc cluster up
oc new-project 'you-project-name'
oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$(oc project -q):default -n $(oc project -q)
----

* CDK

TBD

* AWS Openshift Setup
