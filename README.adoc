= LAB 2

TIME ESTIMATION 30 MINUTES
FOLLOWED by 15 MINUTES explain the solution

== Concepts to be taught in this LAB:

- What is and how to use the EventBus of VertX
- EventBus across multiple MIcroservice Nodes (requires clustering)
- Clustering configuration is provided and mavent-vertx plugn command to start with cluster is given

== Organizers

. Provide solution from - LAB-1 in branch LAB-1 
. Pre-Requisites: and cluster it (infinispan) --> PROVIDE as part of the INITIAL version of LAB 1 Solution


== PARTICIPANTS

.Maven Command To Run VertX outside OCP
----
mvn comiple vertx:run -Dvertx.runArgs="-cluster -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true"
----

. clone/unzip "ReactiveVertX Branch - LAB 1"
. Create Content for verticles in _device-management_ service
  .. consume: Messages from #device-reg on the bus and complete register Device action
  .. ADD the devices into a shared-map (as in previous lab point ....) --WE WILL PROVIDE METHOD FOR THIS
  .. Log operation on console??? WE WILL PROVIDE METHOD FOR THIS THEY JUST NEED TO PUT THE LOGGING

. Create Content for verticles in _*homeplan*_
  .. send: Messages to #device-reg on the bus (REMOVE DUMMY IMPLEMENTATION and implement content of sendDevicesRegistration method

. TESTS
   .. Register HomePlan and seeing on console the devices being registered (give REST Calls)
